# Intel® Smart Edge Open
Intel® Smart Edge Open simplifies the process of creating edge solutions capable
of hosting network functions alongside AI, media processing, and security workloads.

Intel® Smart Edge Open brings together tools from across the cloud-native
landscape that have been extended, and optimized into blueprints for
building edge platforms. This toolkit is designed to meet the challenges
of edge computing, such as resource constraints, network performance, and security.

## Getting Started
### Developer Experience Kit
The Intel® Smart Edge Open Developer Experience Kit lets you
explore the toolkit under an Apache 2.0 license. This foundational kit can be used to create solutions for any edge location.

Find instructions for installing the Developer Experience Kit from GitHub in the
[developer guide](https://smart-edge-open.github.io/docs/experience-kits/developer-experience-kit/).

Alternatively, you can download and run the Developer Experience Kit as a software package from the
[Intel Developer Catalog](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/reference-implementation/smart-edge-open-developer-experience-kit.html).

Reference implementations highlighting end-to-end solutions built on Intel® Smart Edge Open
are available for the Developer Experience Kit. [Download reference implementations](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-catalog/full-catalog.html?s=Newest&q=%22smart+edge+open%22).

### Location-Specific Experience Kits
As cloud architectures disaggregate in the era of 5G, new locations are emerging as prime
candidates for compute workloads that can deliver capabilities and experiences previously not possible.
These new edges include the enterprise, locations within the telco infrastructure, and hyperscaler points of presence.

Intel® Smart Edge Open offers a set of experience kits customized for the requirements of specific edge locations:
- The [5G Private
Wireless Experience Kit with Integrated RAN](https://smart-edge-open.github.io/ido-specs/doc/reference-architectures/smartedge-open-experience-kit-pwek-all-in-one)
and the [uCPE Experience Kit](https://smart-edge-open.github.io/ido-specs/doc/reference-architectures/smartedge-open-experience-kit_sdwan)
are optimized for the on-premises edge, typically located in an enterprise.
- The [Access Edge Experience Kit](https://smart-edge-open.github.io/ido-specs/doc/reference-architectures/ran/smartedge-open_ran)
is for creating edge platforms located at or near a 5G base station.
- The [Near Edge Experience Kit](https://smart-edge-open.github.io/ido-specs/doc/reference-architectures/Smartedge-Open-Experience-Kit-Near-Edge) for creating solutions for aggregation points hosting a distributed UPF (user plane function).

Location-specific experience kits are available under a royalty-free license. To get started with a location-specific experience kit,
